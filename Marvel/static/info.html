                    <p><span>Real Name:</span> Cletus Kasady</p>
                    <p><span>Origin:</span> When Eddie Brock's Venom symbiote soon returned to be bonded again,
                        allowing Venom to escape
                        prison, the symbiote left its offspring in the cell; due to its alien mindset, the symbiote
                        felt no
                        emotional attachment to its offspring, regarding it as insignificant, and thus never
                        communicated
                        its existence to Brock via their telepathic link. The new symbiote then bonded with Brock’s
                        cellmate Cletus Kasady, transforming him into Carnage. The bond between the Carnage symbiote
                        and
                        Kasady was stronger than the bond between Brock and the Venom symbiote. As a result, Carnage is
                        far
                        more violent, powerful, and deadly than Venom. He escaped prison, and began a series of
                        murders,
                        and at the scene of each crime, wrote "Carnage" on the walls with his own blood. He was found
                        by
                        Spider-Man in Kasady's old orphanage, but Spider-Man proved to be no match for Carnage's powers
                        and
                        uncontrollable rage. In desperation, Spider-Man made a truce with Venom to fight Carnage. The
                        Carnage symbiote was defeated and apparently destroyed with sonic weaponry, but unbeknownst to
                        them
                        the symbiote’s deeper equilibrium with its host helped to save it. After entering Kasady’s body
                        through a small cut, it bonded to his blood (which caused its red coloration)</p>
